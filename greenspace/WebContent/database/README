This project is developed to manage forestry and deforestation by storing information about the seeds that are available in nurseries, the trees that have been planted (from seeds in nurseries) and those that have been cut ofcourse from those that had planted and known in the system. This will keep the management of forestry and reduce/remove the mismanagement in the environment care.
